Prediction using Unsupervised ML

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters
and represent it visually.
● Use R or Python or perform this task
● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

Unsupervised ML: When all the data is unlabelled and the algorithms learn to inherent structure from the input data. Basically, we have a set of features we don't know about our target variable or class label. So, with the given dataset, we find some underlying structures or some clusters and hence, we make useful predictions based on that. K-means is a very popular clustering algorithm.
